1. Specify Signal Patterns and
2. Connect Reflexes to Signal Patterns via SignalPatternReflexRoutes
3. Call Signals. The system will match emitted Signal to relevant SignalPatterns registered in the system
    and will launch corresponding Reflexes.
4. Reflex may be the function, or method of class with special initialization scenarios (stateful model)
